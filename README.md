# aurora-android

A smart shoes app, work with Intel Edison Board by using [intel-iot-services-orchestration-layer](https://github.com/01org/intel-iot-services-orchestration-layer).


### Note

This project has become difficult to maintain because of many compromises in the development process.

It's ugly now, and I don't have the time and interest to refactor it.
